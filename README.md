# Deeterministic Finite Automaton

That is just a college work that I did in 2014 about Deterministic Finite Automaton.

The objective of that task was to create a deterministic finite autamaton capable of verify if a word was valid in a set of rules that was defined.

To run this project just runs `npm install socket.io` and execute the app.js file using `node app.js`.

P.S. This repository it's just to me save my college work. You probably dont want to read this code.
